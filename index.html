                <p>In Islam, Qurbani is the act of sacrificing an animal with pure intention for Allah (SWT). All the Muslims around the world perform Qurbani of goats, sheep, cows and camel on the first three days of Eid-ul-Adha. This Eid is celebrated on from the 10th to 13th of Dhul Hijjah.

                    <h3>A Symbolic Sacrifice for Allah</h3>
                    <p>Qurbani, or Udhiya as it is known in Arabic, is not simply the slaughtering of an animal and the distribution of its meat. Nor is it merely a commemorative ritual centred around the sacrifice of Ibrahim (as).

                        The word ‘Qurbani’ is derived from the Arabic, ‘qurban’, which has its root in the Arabic word ‘qurb’ – meaning ‘nearness’. The purpose of offering Qurbani is to draw near to Allah. </p>

                    <h3>Story of Ibrahim (as) and his son</h3>
                    <p>    And when they had both submitted and he (Ibrahim) had laid him on his forehead, We called to him, ‘O Ibrahim, you have fulfilled the vision’. Indeed, in this way We reward the doers of good. Indeed, this was certainly the clear trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice, and We left for him (favourable mention) among later generations: ‘Peace upon Ibrahim.'”

                    <p>The Qurbani that we perform today is according to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (saw). On the first day of Eid al-Adha (10th Dhul Hijjah), after Eid prayer, we sacrifice an animal for the sake of Allah and then distribute its meat to the needy. </p>

                    <h3>A Celebration with the Ummah</h3>
                    <p>Ultimately, although we are sacrificing for the sake of Allah, the meat is also distributed to the poor people in the Ummah. The sacrifice is given to the needy in the same way that Zakat al-Fitr is given at the end of Ramadan so that they can enjoy a meal on the days of Eid.

                        For poor families, meat is an unaffordable luxury and so it is a joyous occasion when they can enjoy a Qurbani meal. </p>

While the word and concept are similar as in other Abrahamic religions, there is notably an opposition of the burnt offering,[3] with the spoils of the sacrifice being distributed as food to the impoverished and family of the one making the offering for consumption. </p>

This is not surprising because God forgives anyone who turns to Him in genuine repentance, even when the sins he has committed are grave indeed.</p>
